# offl1n3 - my js13kgames entry

## "Story"
You're playing an MMO with your friends, when suddenly you get disconnected from the internet for the third time that day. You decide you've had enough, and go to your ISP to get revenge.

## Props
Huge props to:
* my brother, for playtesting
* Dominic Szablewski, for open-sourcing Weltmeister.
